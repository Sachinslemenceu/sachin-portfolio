## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Computer Science undergraduate** with a strong focus on **Android application development** and **real-time system design**. I enjoy building **production-oriented software** that solves real-world problems, especially where mobile applications interact with hardware, QR systems, or desktop environments.

I have hands-on experience working with **Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and modern Android architecture patterns**, and I actively design systems with scalability, performance, and maintainability in mind. I am currently involved in developing **medical-grade Android applications** and collaborating with cross-functional teams in enterprise environments.

My long-term interests include **distributed systems, real-time data processing, and applied software engineering**.
